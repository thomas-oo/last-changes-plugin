The simplest way to know what has changed on your Jenkins builds!

Last Changes is a *Jenkin plugin* that shows _rich VCS diffs_ between builds.

IMPORTANT: Only `Git` and `Svn` based projects are supported.

== Introduction

The plugin uses https://diff2html.rtfpessoa.xyz/[diff2html^] to show last changes of a given build, example:

image::https://github.com/jenkinsci/last-changes-plugin/blob/master/images/last-changes03.png?raw=true[]

Or using side-by-side configuration:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/last-changes-plugin/master/images/last-changes05.png[]


NOTE: Last changes means `compare current repository revision with an old revision`. By default the plugin will diff current and previous revisions.

== Objectives

The main objective of this plugin is to have _fast_ access to what has changed on a Jenkins build.

Another interesting aspect is that it can easily help to find the `root cause` of a `failling build` by highlighting what has changed.

And finally the plugin _shines_ in a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery[*continuous delivery*^] environment, where each _commit_ generates a release candidate.


== How it works?

. This plugin expects `git` or `svn` based builds (a.k.a _Source Code Management_ configuration section).
. While your job runs the plugin reads your build workspace to retrieve the current VCS revision;
. The diff between `actual` and `old` revisions will be stored; Note that `old` revision can be provided in plugin configuration. If no revision is provided then previous repository revision will be used.
. The `diff` for each build can be viewed later in html format.

IMPORTANT: To get most from this plugin use `periodically SCM pooling` to trigger your builds, http://www.nailedtothex.org/roller/kyle/entry/articles-jenkins-poll[more details here^].

WARNING: The plugin *always* compare current revision with old one even no new commit has been made.

== Usage

After installation just activate the post build action named *Publish Last Changes*.

. Activate build action

. Last changes menu should be available

. Build changes history

. Last changes menu is available for builds that published changes

== Configuration

The setup is done via `build configuration` and basically reflects https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html#configuration[diff2html options^]:

== Jenkins pipeline step (since version 1.0.7)

Following is an example of pipeline step using this plugin:

----
node {
    checkout([$class: 'SubversionSCM', additionalCredentials: [], excludedCommitMessages: '', excludedRegions: '', excludedRevprop: '', excludedUsers: '', filterChangelog: false, ignoreDirPropChanges: false, includedRegions: '', locations: [[credentialsId: '', depthOption: 'infinity', ignoreExternalsOption: true, local: '.', remote: 'https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/cucumber-json-files/trunk']], workspaceUpdater: [$class: 'UpdateUpdater']])
    step([$class: 'LastChangesPublisher', format: 'LINE', matchWordsThreshold: '0.25', matching: 'NONE', matchingMaxComparisons: '1000', showFiles: true, synchronisedScroll: true, endRevision: ''])
}
----

NOTE: Empty *endRevision* will set endRevision to previous repository revision.
 
 
== Docker

An easy way to test this plugin is using a docker container, here are the steps (assumming you have docker installed):

. Run the image:
+
----
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 rmpestano/jenkins-last-changes
----
+
. Access localhot:8080/ and create a job
. Configure this svn repository: https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/cucumber-json-files/trunk/ 
. Add the *Publish last changes* _post build action_;
. Just run the job

 
Job output should look like:
